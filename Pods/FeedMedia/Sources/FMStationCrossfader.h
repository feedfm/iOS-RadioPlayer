/**
 * The FMStationCrossfader allows you to tie music player actions (such as station changes
 * and volume changes) to cue points. The basic use case is to change stations and volume
 * while playing instructional audio in a separate audio player.
 *
 * Basic class usage works like so:
 * Create an instance of the class with an array of time offsets (cue points) and the actions
 * you want to happen at those times. The current implementation allows you to change the
 * current station or volume. You can create an instance like so:
 *
 *    FMStationCrossfader *cf = [FMSTationCrossfade stationCrossfaderWithInitialStation:@{ @"bpm": @"slow" },
 *                                               andCuePoints: @[
 *                                                      // at 5 seconds in, change the volume to 0.5
 *                                                      5.0f, @0.5f,
 *                                                      // also at 5 seconds in, crosfade to the station
 *                                                      // with a 'bpm' value of 'medium'
 *                                                      5.0f, @{ @"bpm": @"medium" },
 *                                                      // at 10 seconds in, change volume to 1.0
 *                                                      10.0f, @1.0f,
 *                                                      // and crossfade to station with 'bpm' of 'high'
 *                                                      10.0f, @{ @"bpm": @"high" }
 *                                               ]];
 *
 * Alternatively, you can create an instance of the class with no cue points and then use
 * playStation:startingAtTime: and setVolume:startingAtTime to add cue points.
 *
 * When you have added all the cue points, make a call to:
 *
 * [cf connect];
 *
 * Now, as your external media elapses, inform the station crossfader:
 *
 * [cf elapseToTime: _externalMediaPlayer.currentElapsedTime]
 *
 * which call will cause the crossfader to update the current station and volume
 * settings as per the cue points.
 *
 * When any external media that the cue points are connected to starts playback
 * or pauses playback, you should call `[cf play]` or `[cf pause]`.
 *
 * If the user pauses playback of music (independent of your external media), then
 * call [cf disconnect] so that music stays paused until the user turns it back on
 * again. When the user wants to resume playback, call [cf reconnect].

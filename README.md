# Overview

This is an official Feed.fm iOS app that makes use of the Feed Media SDK
to power a Pandora-style Internet-radio app. The app 
shows how you can use station metadata to hide stations
and assign images and descriptive text to them.

This player will retrieve the list of stations to display
from the server and display or hide the station selector
accordingly. Background images for the music stations
are provided to the client along with station metadata.
If background aren't provided by the server, there is a
default image provided in the FMPlayerAssets.xcassets file.

Check out our [Android version](https://github.com/feedfm/Android-RadioPlayer) and
our [other sample iOS player](https://github.com/feedfm/iOS-RadioPlayer-2) as well!
